# Passenger Counter App

This project is a simple yet functional Passenger Counter App, designed to count the number of passengers entering a bus or event. I built this project to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, focusing on DOM manipulation and function creation. To make the app more engaging, I integrated both an increment and decrement function, allowing users to adjust the count in real time. Additionally, I applied a minimalist and sleek UI based on modern design trends to make the user experience more intuitive and visually appealing.

## What I Learned

- The mini project helped me solidify key JavaScript concepts like variable scoping, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
- ained experience in integrating JavaScript functionality with CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Learnt the importance of keeping code clean and organized for easier debugging and maintenance.

## Challenges I Faced

- Implementing a conditional check to prevent the decrement function from reducing the count below zero.
- Integrated alert box to handle errors, specifically to notify users when trying to decrease the count below zero.

## Overall Review

This project was an excellent practice for refining my JavaScript skills and implementing them in a real-world scenario. The process of building both the functionality and the UI helped me better understand the workflow of front-end development. By adding my personal touch, such as the decrement function, I was able to push my learning further and explore practical problem-solving.
